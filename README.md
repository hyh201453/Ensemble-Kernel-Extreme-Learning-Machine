# Ensemble-Kernel-Extreme-Learning-Machine
##This is example codes of eKELM, tested on the dataset that the movement onsets have been located and aligned.

Steps:

1.Download the data from https://ninapro.hevs.ch/, which includes 17 isometric and isotonic hand configurations, as well as basic wrist movements. 

2.Extract the files to the "example_data" directory.

3.Change data acquisition parameters for feature extraction in the ‘Main_Script.m’.

4.Change the dimensionality reduction parameters and algorithm parameters in the ‘Main_Script.m’ as required.

5.Run "Main_Script.m".
